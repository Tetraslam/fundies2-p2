Changes to Data Definitions

1. Changes Made to Previous Data Definitions:
   - Added a new IGroundType implementation for Hole
   - Modified the Cell class to handle interactions with holes
   - Added game state tracking for player falling into holes
   - Implemented mechanics for objects disappearing when falling into holes
   - Added a distinction between winning and losing game states

2. If We Had Known About Holes:
   Our original design actually accommodated this change fairly well because:
   - We separated ground types from cell contents, making it easy to add new ground types
   - We implemented proper interactions between elements
   - Our movement logic was already handling special cases

   However, we would have:
   - Designed the cell interaction system with more generic "special effect" handling
   - Created a more comprehensive event system for tracking game state changes
   - Added more abstraction for the "disappearing" mechanics

3. Accommodating Future Changes:
   Our revised data definitions are now more extensible:
   - The separation between ground types and cell contents allows adding new types easily
   - The interaction system is now event-based rather than hardcoded for specific types
   - The rendering system is decoupled from the game logic
   - New special cell behaviors can be added by implementing the appropriate interfaces
   - The level construction from strings can be extended with new character mappings

   For future enhancements like:
   - Ice tiles (that make the player slide)
   - Teleporters
   - Multi-level puzzles
   - Timed challenges

   We would only need to:
   - Add new implementations of IGroundType or ICellContent
   - Extend the interaction logic in the SokobanLevel class
   - Add new character mappings for level construction
   - Implement any new rendering for the new elements

   The core architecture is now flexible enough to accommodate these changes without major restructuring.
