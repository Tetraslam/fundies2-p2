Merging Design Document

When merging our two implementations, we focused on combining the strongest aspects of each design while ensuring maintainability and extensibility.

Similarities:
- Both implementations used a grid-based board representation
- Both had a clear separation between ground elements and cell contents
- Both supported player movement and basic trophy/target mechanics

Differences:
- Implementation A used a functional approach with immutable data structures
- Implementation B used a mutable approach with ArrayList for better performance
- Implementation A had more rigorous testing but slower performance
- Implementation B had better rendering and UI but less robust error handling

Decisions:
1. We chose the mutable approach using ArrayList from Implementation B because:
   - It offers better performance for large game boards
   - It simplifies the implementation of game mechanics
   - It makes the code more readable for future extensions

2. We kept the clear separation between ground types and cell contents from both implementations:
   - This allows easy addition of new elements like holes
   - It maintains the ability to have elements on top of other elements (e.g., trophies on targets)

3. We enhanced the error handling from Implementation A:
   - Better validation of level strings
   - Comprehensive checking of game rules and constraints

4. We improved the rendering and UI from Implementation B:
   - Cleaner visual representation
   - Better game state feedback

5. We combined the testing approaches from both:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for core mechanisms
   - Integration tests for complete game flows

Changes to Previous Designs:
1. Switched from Funworld to Impworld for better control of game state
2. Enhanced data structures to allow for extension with new tile types
3. Implemented a more robust position system for tracking game elements
4. Improved level loading from string representations
