Sokoban Game - User Guide

Game Objective:
The goal of Sokoban is to push all colored trophies onto their matching colored targets.
For example, red trophies must go on red targets, blue on blue, etc.

Controls:
- Use arrow keys to move the player (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- The player can only move in four directions (no diagonals)

Game Rules:
1. The player cannot walk through walls
2. The player can push one trophy or crate at a time
3. The player cannot push two or more items at once
4. Items can be pushed onto targets
5. The game is won when all colored trophies are on their matching targets

Special Elements:
- Holes: If a player or any pushable item falls into a hole, both the item and hole disappear
- Warning: If the player falls into a hole, the game ends in failure!

Tips:
- Plan your moves carefully - it's easy to push trophies into positions where they can't be moved
- Be especially careful around holes
- Think about the order of moving trophies - sometimes you need to move one trophy to make way for another

Advanced Strategy:
- Try to clear a path to targets first
- Work from the back of the puzzle toward the front
- Sometimes you need to temporarily move a trophy away from its target to allow other trophies to pass

Good luck!
